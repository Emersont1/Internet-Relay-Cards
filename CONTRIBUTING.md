# Code Stanards
Code Should be:
+ Working - Feel free to submit a pull request, but mark it as draft until its ready to be merged
+ Consitent with the existing codebase
  + Classes, data members and publicly accessible things in `PascalCase`
    + Single word private or function scope variables are permitted to be in lowercase
  + XML Summaries on everything public - the compiler should complain otherwise
    + Empty Line BEFORE an XML Summary
  + Beautified/Properly Indented (I'm Using C#FixFormat for VScode with default options)
+ Tested with NUnit where possible
+ Examples given where possible
